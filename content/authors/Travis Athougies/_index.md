Travis founded Intrustd Computing based on the radical notion that we
should be in charge of our own data. After the birth of his daughter,
he didn't want his daughter's photos owned by Facebook, Google,
Microsoft, or Apple, so he wrote some software to make sure he could
while still being able to share baby pictures with family.
