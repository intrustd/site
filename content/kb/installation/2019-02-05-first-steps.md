# After Purchase

After the purchase of an Intrustd appliance, there's nothing you need
to do. You can expect to receive a tracking number when your package
is sent, and should receive your device a few days later.

# When You Receive the Device

Other than the device itself, you should receive the following with your purchase:

* The Intrustd Manual
* A power supply cord
* An Intrustd setup certificate
* 5 USB keys with the Intrustd logo
* 3 Intrustd stickers

# Setup Options

The easiest way to setup your device is via a computer, iPhone, or
Android device connected to your local home network. If you do not
have direct internet access to your device, you should follow
the
[alternate setup instructions](kb/installation/2019-02-05-installation-without-network.md).

For smartphone instructions,
go [here](#installation-with-a-smartphone). For PC or Mac
instructions, go [here](#installation-with-a-desktop).

# Installation with a Smartphone

## Download Apps

Download the Intrustd computing app for iOS or Android

<!-- TODO add links -->
* iTunes store link for iPhone or iPad
* Google Play store link for Android

## Launch App

After the application is installed, click on the Intrustd computing
logo. You will be brought to a screen asking you to connect to a new
device. Click on the option to install a device from the local
network.

Your Intrustd device should appear. If you have more than one device
on the local network, you can verify that you are connecting to the
right device by verifying the serial number on the screen with the
serial number on the device.

If you've never logged in to your device before, you will be asked to
create a new administrator account. Make sure to choose a good
password to protect and secure your account.

Click 'Next >' to continue to the next screen.

## Create User Accounts

You should now find yourself at the Intrustd desktop.

You may want to add additional accounts for members of your
household. Click on the 'Add User' button.

You can opt to add a user directly or to send a link to another person
that will allow them to create one account.

### Add a User Directly

To add a user directly, select the 'Create User Now' option. You will
have to supply a name and password. You may opt to add a photo for
display purposes.

### Invite a User

To invite a user, select the 'Invite User...' option. Either the
iPhone or Android share dialog will show. Select how you'd like to
invite friends. We recommend a secure channel such as WhatsApp.

That's it! Your friend will be able to use the link you just sent to
create one account on this device.

You should now be ready for [next steps](#next-steps).
