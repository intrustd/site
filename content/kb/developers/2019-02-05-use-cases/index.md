# Purpose of Article

This article seeks to enumerate sample use cases for Intrustd
applications. The purpose is to determine which applications would be
a good fit for Intrustd computing and which would not.

# Positive Use Cases

The following use-cases represent areas where applications can add
significant value via ports to the Intrustd platform.

## Data-driven applications

Data-driven applications, like photo managers, file managers, backup
solutions, are good candidates for hosting on Intrustd
appliances. Users often find these data valuable and want to maintain
maximal control over it, rather than outsourcing their storage (even
encrypted) to other vendors.

## Privacy conscious applications

Privacy conscious applications like those dealing with financial or
health data are perfect for Intrustd. Store data on secure, encrypted
disks, and make it available via the Intrustd SDK. Enable internet
access to automatically download data from banks, financial
institutions, hospitals, and clinics.

## P2P Communication

Traditional instant messaging and video conferencing applications
require the set up and ongoing maintenance of high-end servers and
bandwidth. Using the already existing Intrustd appliance P2P network,
deploy your application to many different edge locations. Since each
end-user accesses an application using their own appliance, your
application naturally scales depending on the number of users.

## Blockchains

With an internet-enabled application, deploy your blockchain
technology directly to the Intrustd appliance network. The owners of
cryptocurrency on your block chain join in the pool as miners,
donating their extra Intrustd appliance compute capacity. End users
benefit because they self-host their wallets, instead of depending on
sometimes questionable middlemen.

# Negative Use Cases

Not all applications benefit from the Intrustd model. The following
use-cases represent areas where it's best to stick with a
client-server architecture.
