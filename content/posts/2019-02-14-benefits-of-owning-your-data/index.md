Data. It's everywhere, and that's not necessarily a good
thing. Details on your personal life live in a variety of data centers
readily available for large institutions to study your behavior and do
creepy things.

Reason 1: It can't be taken without your knowledge
-------

When you send your data to a server somewhere on the internet, you often have no idea how that
server is configured or whether it's running trustworthy software. You may have just uploaded your
documents to a trustworthy website that cares about data privacy, or you may have sent them to a
company that makes sure to
let
[Uncle Sam know](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data) exactly
what you're doing.

Reason 2: It can't be sold
-------

'Free' services are often not free. Remember, if you're not paying, you're not the customer. The
customer is you. Oftentimes, even paid sites pad their pockets by selling your data. Marketing
companies use it to track your interests, your lifestyle, your marital status, and the name of your
second cousin twice removed. Do you really want that level of information out there, for others to
profit off of?

Don't worry though you can opt out of all hundred (thousand? who knows?) companies using your
data. Just follow the
steps
[here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90310803/here-are-the-data-brokers-quietly-buying-and-selling-your-personal-information). Oh,
by the way, this only works if you live in Vermont.

Or, you can just own your own data.

Reason 3: It can't be used to creep on you
------

Okay, so perhaps your favorite company isn't _selling_ your data? You have nothing to worry about, right?

Reason 4: It won't land up in a coffee shop somewhere
-------

Alright, so we really are dealing with good guys who aren't selling or giving away your data. That
doesn't mean you know where it is. Your data could be on a server in a data center, or it could be
on the laptop of a tired, overworked engineer, who just might lose it. Think that doesn't happen?
According to Gartner, it happens every 53 seconds. You better hope every company you've done
business with
followed

Reason 5: It won't be accessible to creepy employees
------

Once you upload your data to another company's servers, it's effectively their property. No amount
of law could fix this. Even if the company is trustworthy, employees with nefarious motives may have
access to their data.

Did you send embarassing photos on Snapchat? All you need is faith that the potentially hundreds of
thousands of employees have only the purest of motives. After all, only maybe a couple are
like
