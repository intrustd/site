When You Receive the Device Other than the device itself, you should receive the following with your purchase:
 The Intrustd Manual A power supply cord An Intrustd setup certificate 5 USB keys with the Intrustd logo 3 Intrustd stickers  Setup Options The easiest way to setup your device is via a computer, iPhone, or Android device connected to your local home network.</description>

      <description> Who should read this document The easiest way to set up an Intrustd appliance is via a computer or smart device with a browser attached to the same network. In rare situations, this is not possible. In this case, you can create a temporary globally-available access portal using the USB keys included in the box with your appliance.
